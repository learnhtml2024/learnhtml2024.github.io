            <h2>Farm-to-table</h2>
            <p>Our teams make sure that all of our foods and products come from the same farm,
                that does not use pesticides, as to not cross contaminate. This is because
                we are all vegetarian, and a little bit of a vegan restaurant. We send a team
                to the farm and make sure that there is no cross contamination when loading the
                ingredients into the truck. Then our team drives the truck to our restaurant
                and begins loading the contents into our fridges, pantries, and freezer that
                were all previously wiped down. After that, we wash all of the vegetables and
                fruits thoroughly in salt water. We let them soak for about 20-30 minutes to
                get rid of any bacteria and contaminants. All of our kitchen equipment is
                thoroughly cleaned every day, two times a day, and our staff wash their hands
                before every meal they make. This is our process: from farm to table!

            <h2>Handling Ingredients</h2>
            <p>To ensure that all of our food is fresh and organic, we make all of our breads,
                cheeses, sauces, and the various pastas by hand. We prepare these ingredients
                at the start of each day; this way you get the most flavor out of your dish.
                We absolutely refuse to reheat all of our dishes before sending them to customers,
                which is why we freshly cook everything beforehand. For example, the pasta will
                be boiled as soon as you order and all of our fried dishes will be warm and crispy.
                At our restaurant, we hope to mimic that of a homely feeling- like a warm hug of
                flavors.
